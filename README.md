# Galder_Bilbao_Thesis
Repository including all the files created during the thesis.
This repository contains the complete set of files developed as part of my thesis project: Data acquisition system and bellmouth intake design for microturbojet test bench. For detailed explanations regarding the contents, purpose, and application of each component, please refer to the main thesis document.

Throughout the project, various aspects of the test bench were studied and organized into dedicated folders based on functionality:

# Bellmouth_Designs
This folder contains Autodesk Inventor files and STEP files related to bellmouth intake system. Skecths of the design are also attached. The following designs are provided:
  * Initial bellmouth design
  * Final bellmouth design
  * Bellmouth support
  * Bellmouth central test
  * 2D domain
  * 3D domain with struts
  * 3D domain without struts
  * 3D domain lateral wind simulation
    
# Data_acquisition_code
In this file all the programming code that makes the data acquisition system work can be found. This code is uploaded to the ESP32-S3 microcontroller, through Platformio in visual studio code. All the programing is done in c++ and headers, functions and main files can be found.

# PCB_Design
The PCB design was made using KiCAD software. This folder includes schematics files, board layout and desing file for the general board.
